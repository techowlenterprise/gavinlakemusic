And we're off! First wedding of the year for me after taking a month or so off recovering from what was a crazy amount of weddings last year! This one was at Yew Lodge Hotel in Kegworth which is only about 30 minutes from me in NW Leicestershire (nice to have a local one!!). The hotel is part of 'the best western' chain and they are all pretty good. The staff were super friendly and even offered me a meal in their 'marco pierre white' restaurant, ahh go on then.

For this wedding I played acoustic music for an hour or so during drinks/canapes, this was about 2:30pm kind of time. Followed by another hours set after the wedding party had eaten at 6:30pm.

 

Playing in the later slot, after the wedding breakfast filled that tricky hole between speeches and evening guests arriving. It's definitely worth considering instead of booking for during the wedding breakfast itself.
